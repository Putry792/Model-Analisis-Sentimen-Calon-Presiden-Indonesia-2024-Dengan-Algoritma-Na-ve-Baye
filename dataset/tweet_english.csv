"Don't be rude to public figures, models like Loebekas, comics aren't funny, artists are also mostly just backup extras, if anyone wants to follow, don't compare them to smart people, no need, Mr. Anies, Cakimin, just the fans, Abah Kirun, you're definitely going to be awoke."
"Indra Charismiadji, spokesperson for the winning national team, Anies Baswedancak, Imin Amin, was arrested following his profile"
Blunders make the candidate lose money
"Yes, Anies is a descendant of a national hero. If you don't know, Sie"
Cakimin Imin goes beyond Bandung Bondowoso
"Actually, it's not necessarily that he considers it a burden, but more like his behavior that seems to want to show more than feeling more worthy of being a presidential candidate, this has been confirmed because even though we still solidly support him, it's better for him to know himself."
just be realistic
Budiman Sudjatmiko said that Cakimin Imin's understanding may not be perfect regarding the fish of the Indonesian archipelago
"Sir, you definitely won't believe Anies and Cakimin's false promises"

"Unexpectedly, I gave the call to prayer to support Candidate Candidate No"
"From the start, it was wrong to want to save the PDP, but nominating the president from your own cadres, try to be brave enough to take the middle path. Nominating to be the presidential candidate and vice presidential candidate will be an exciting battle in Java against Cakimin."
"the track record is indeed happy, please share it on tiktok and ig, guys, thank you, ma'am"
campaigns must still use common sense
"Cakimin, the political machine can still be the one who belittles his life only on social media lol, that's because yesterday's presidential election felt like he was being grabbed by Cakimin. Sewing clothes to be announced as Vice President, JKW finally canceled because of his ploy."
is kind of sad amp nothing much we can do about it as a society can only make jokes behind their crimes amp sins
cakimin is yntkts

"no need to talk about eradicating corruption, take care of that friend first"
"Come on, change your strategy before you sink"

"well, something like this makes me lazy to support it too much, I feel superior about brains, saying fafifu just chooses a representative, cakimin hahaha"
"not understanding and then asking is more honorable. Intellectual honesty is needed, which is one of the characteristics of a leader who is worthy of being chosen"
"It may be cool, I've never been interested in politics this year, but I'm tired of this year, finally there's a really cool hope, God willing, if I'm given the opportunity, I'll vote for him"
"It's clear that Cakimin isn't the one who wants to be complicated because he is anti-complicated. It's more practical if you still want to believe his bullshit, weeeesss monggoooo"
nepo baby insisted Anis
"Yes, maybe Cakimin doesn't know what Indonesia's ranking is, so he just expressed his idea on how to increase the ranking."
a number of kiai in Central Java and East Java expressed their support for the presidential and vice presidential candidate pairs Anies Baswedan and Muhaimin Iskandar in the general election
"PBNU General Chairman Gus Yahya Says Cakimin Imin Will Not Win the Presidential Election, Anies Baswedan's Response Through"
"we read from behind Prabowogibran Ganjarmahfud Aniescakimin, Indonesia must be victorious, Indonesia must become global, it must be Anies Baswedan, greetings of change."
"Still don't accept it, the candidate pair is asked about the abbreviation Sgie, Cakimin should understand it, it's not foreign to sharia economic actors, so now people know that tyt Cakimin doesn't have any concerns about Sharia economics, I'm surprised the media really hates that, what's wrong with that?"
be even harder to come down to Cakimin to ensure victory in East Java and Central Java to compensate for your performance which was not optimal in yesterday's vice presidential debate.
"I'm sorry, Cakimin is also the gofar's tea"
See what it's like

"Answer first, where is the evidence that SP told Anies to replace Ahy with Cakimin, if Otaklu is functioning, of course you know that your tweet is not the answer to that question."
It's a sin not to laugh at Cakimin's slow TikTok videos
"Anies Baswedan said to himself, he has a representative, why is he so ridiculous, Imin"
"Amin's spokesperson is intelligent and his public speaking is good, he responds to Gibran's remarks during the vice presidential debate. In the past, Cakimin supported IKN but now he refuses to talk about it. He respects all of Amin's spokespersons from young people as well as genz and his speech is all good and coherent like those who are supported."
"be calm, be careful with your answer, cakimin"
"Well, you know, I also wonder why the praise for Cakimin, who was betrayed by Gusdur, is considered a great person."
"you ran too far from the context of our conversation at the beginning and end of it, you always brought up Jokowi's name even though it is clear that the current choice has been determined, namely Aniscakimin Prabowogibran Ganjarmahfud"
"everyone gets the same mic share, remember the second principle of Pancasila, just and civilized humanity"
"who said that most of the groups supporting Anies Cakimin that I entered are still realistic, if Anies loses in the first round, hopefully not, in the second round we will definitely choose to reward"
"Well, it's not dangerous or not"
The plan of candidate pair number one Muhaimin Iskandar Cakimin Imin to build a city at the level of Jakarta is considered less realistic
"It's natural for a sycophant to praise his candidate pair, but look behind your vice presidential candidate, framing Cakimin as inconsistent, even though he himself is the one who is inconsistent, he says he's not old enough, he can't live as president, eh, that's a bad idea to mentally help Uncle MK, he's more inconsistent, aka a traitor to democracy."
"Anies Baswedan explained the idea put forward by his vice presidential candidate, Muhaimin Iskandar, who said he would build a city like Jakarta. Download now on Play Store and App Store."
"When Anies Baswedan was confused by Cakimin Imin's blunder, he felt that he had chosen the wrong representative"
"From Manasih Ahy's point of view, it's better than Cakimin Nil, only people who don't understand politics say that"
"Vice President Amin Cakimin was the one who staged a coup and forcibly removed Gus Dur from his position as chairman of the PKB, a political party formed by Gus Dur."

Cakimin Imin admitted that he would build a city equivalent to Jakarta during the vice presidential debate. Urban observer Yayat said that Cakimin Imin's words were political jargon and difficult to implement.
This is related to the statement by vice presidential candidate serial number Muhaimin Iskandar who believes that Indonesia must build a new city at the level of DKI Jakarta.
Amin's partner's campaign funds of only IDR billion were considered odd until they were reported to Bawaslu. This is Cakimin Imin's explanation
"The target is ikn then we will add to what Cakimin has explained about the Samsul taste period and now it's still Samsul's father, what he said means it's always upside down"
"actually you are a doctor so you know you don't examine but you know analyzing people who have this syndrome, it's like a shaman playing guessing games, look at the other vice presidential candidates, you read the same, what else is that cakimin from the opening, you cheated on reading, so if you watch the debate"
Mayor Rahmad Masud objected to Balikpapan being called Cakimin Imin's lack of clean water and electricity
"Aniescak Imin will build a city equivalent to Jakarta, not from scratch and different from this, said a passing observer"
Mayor Rahmad Masud's response to Cakimin Imin about Balikpapan and building KotaSetarajakarta is through
and Cakimin supports it
"There is evidence that Paloh told Anies S in political science, even those of us who are ordinary people know that in gaining votes for the PKB it is stronger than the Democrats and that the senior politician from the 1990s is a figure who is really needed to lobby the DPR in the future so that his policies can be passed compared to Ahy, who is far away."
The cakimin just said he agreed at that time
Bill's idol is Cakimin
"I'm really excited about Mr. Tom, just ask, Mr. Tom, from what you said, which cities have been realized, then just ask again, IKN or cities like Cakimin said."
"it's true, as long as it sounds really cakimin, it's like the speeding system has run out last night, aka he's just doing it carelessly, can he still change his deputy, sir, it seems like it's not good because it's his own friend, but why is this the model?"
"Instead, the DKJ bill was a proposal from the DPR and PKB and Nasdem, part of which initially agreed. All political parties except PKS, which firmly rejected it, meant not only for Gibran Donk, but also for Cakimin and Prop MUD or UD who was pessimistic about winning."
"During yesterday's debate, Gibran looked very polite towards Prof. Mahfudz and Cakimin, especially when the closing statement was closed with Salim to Prof. Mahfudz and Cakimin."

"everyone is tense and worried about whether Susanti Marshanda's bedtime at night, just one virtual presidential break card"
Prabowo was asked about why he was so emotional and afraid of being exposed if he was the perpetrator at night. Susanti Marsanda slept at 11:00 a.m. One virtual presidential rest card was enough.
"Feri Amsari Prabowo Gibran has no capacity in the presidential candidate debate, the point is different levels bro, at night you sleep at Susanti Marshanda's hour, just one virtual presidential break card"
"Supporters said they were firm, even though they were just emotional at night, Susanti Marshanda's sleep at night was enough for a virtual presidential break card"

"the once-annual fried issue that always comes out before the general election, of course, if it's not to graze Mr. Prabowo, let alone make it clear, yes, the reward question just wants to discredit Prabowo."
"But maybe it's also because of the lack of politicians that the actions seem to be firm, brave and genuine without calculating for the sake of the progress of the nation. Maybe this behavior is what caused Gus Dur to call Prabowo the most sincere leader."
"He also lacks the spirit of a politician, so as he once admitted, in the political arena he lived in after retiring from the military, he was often betrayed and even betrayed by friends and opponents."
"Apart from everything that has been done according to the law and regulations, those who have dealt with it in the past have also provided testimony and information which more or less brings Prabowo to his current condition."
the idea of ​​law enforcement is clear that the law and the constitution must be enforced and implemented
"I also didn't think about the question of the feelings expressed by the other two candidate pairs regarding Prabowo's idea that when the law is still and binding, the only choice is to implement it, not how he feels."
Anies thinks Prabowo can't stand being in the opposition even though in reality he just listens to what Bang Andre says
Maybe it's true that there's a lack of political spirit so they come here with just one goal of conveying ideas and competing ideas. Maybe Prabowo didn't think that the debate would discuss cases one by one even though the ideas should be comprehensive.

Ahok is indeed the one who can work but the one who is accepted in society is Anis because of the blunder of identity politics. Almaidah Bu Mega wants Puan to be advanced but the party cadres and society want to reward those who are advanced because building PDI has taken a long time. I haven't heard of meritocracy for a long time. I hope the candidate pairs will be aware.
"The candidate pair is the result of nepotism, that is an undeniable fact"

"cancel it, don't wait, eliminate the candidate pair as soon as possible before February because there is a possibility that they will commit fraud later, that candidate pair is unconstitutional"
this is the candidate pair's professor
"The Constitution orders the government to make the nation smarter, the undergraduate program for the poor is a Constitutional mandate carried out by the UUD candidate pairs. There is no mandate to fill the nation's stomachs with the free lunch program promoted by the Candidate Candidates. So which programs are relevant to the Constitution?"
"I'm surprised that the supporters of the candidate pair are already legally disabled, but they wonder what will happen to Indonesia if someone who is legally disabled is the leader."
"Boy Tohir is also equally stupid and stupid, claiming that the conglomerate supports the candidate pair, finally being denied by Djarumadaro, etc."
"Humility does not mean low self-esteem, the best type of leader to bring Indonesia forward"

Most of the people who join the candidate pair are also problematic
fighting doesn't mean dropping
"Yes, Ahok is being sacrificed and asked to come forward to talk about controversial matters. If you turn around about performance, you can be completely naked, Ahok, try to act in the greater interest, not just electoral interests, because of the greater interest, we stand firmly for the candidate pair."

"regarding the hoax circulating that state-owned companies will be converted into cooperatives if candidate pairs Anies and Cakimin Imin win, it turns out this is the fact"
"According to Ogut, Jain Ja und Nein is more appropriate for another candidate pair without any problem as to why the legitimacy of the next government is problematic, only if the candidate pair insists on winning, that's when the whole people have to remove them for a reason."
"Jokowi is politicizing the government's social assistance program, all efforts are being made to win the candidate pair. A number of academics, Rocky Gerung, criticized this effort as leading to a violation of the ethics of the KPU chairman. Is Indonesia going to give birth to a leader who is flawed in terms of law, moral ethics?"
I feel like Wonderwoman after fighting against candidate pair haters on TikTok
"Always believe that Prabowo-Gibran can bring peace and prosperity to the people he loves, step firmly and win the candidate pair"
the gesture of the candidate pair in the media that they will be superior and candidate pair and that they are far behind can be seen how much Anies is pushing to become more popular and the people's response is like welcoming the president while their campaign is empty of spectators.
if a president has been degraded if slander has been spread everywhere just one word against

"DKPP avoids extraordinary events. If the candidate pair fails, the president will gas his power pool and the supporters will use pencak silat"
"In the past, Wiranto also talked about things like that, but in reality he lost the presidential election, it will definitely spread to the candidate pairs"
"The ones who are panicking are you candidates and if your electability isn't up to par, that's why JKW is forcing more social assistance until the end of the round even though the budget has run out and instructing every ministry to block its budget to stand by this social assistance fund."

best candidate
It's great that the electability of the candidate pair is increasing
It is acknowledged that the candidate pair has very careful strategy and added support
"After the debate, observers said the presidential candidates had not yet addressed the welfare issue."
Viral Aurel and Krisdayanti remain united despite netizens' different choices of salfok hand styles for both of them
"Oh, your presidential and vice presidential candidates are real proof of what DKI Jakarta is. There's no need to talk about it over and over again. All the results of the candidate's work. By the way, the candidate pair is not worthy of running. They are violating the constitution. Come on, Gen Z, rise up. Don't be fooled by the Got dynasty."
"the stage was prepared for the candidate pairs, just for fun, with prizes for the sake of the mission to save the bull party's votes which were starting to fall, Pak Jokowi never betrayed them and Bu Mega, they still had one goal, I can't imagine if Anis won, how confused the stakeholders would be"
The brains of those candidate candidate supporters have short-circuited
"where is the split narrative that you are still pretending to be stupid with the violations that have occurred from the beginning of the middle school court lawsuit with an unfair campaign, winning honorably has far more potential for the candidate pair than winning and losing humiliation for the candidate pair."
This is the behavior of candidate pair supporters who like to spread hoax news
"The more you post fake news, the more the people and the candidate pair will move away. Thank you TV One so that all the candidate pair supporters will vote Amen"
"That's right, I'm also a candidate supporter in the group of retirees who have already retired. I hate Anies using narratives like buzzers even though I'm well educated."

"Soon the village head will resign, why are you afraid of your opponent and then spying on the candidate pair who will fall? That's the most logical way"
It's not even claimed as a gift to Wiwi Paslon
"Logically, WIWI will overthrow the Octb for ASN who are intimidated into supporting the key candidate pair, they say they are against it by overthrowing the Wiwi candidate pair, then all intimidation will end, do you understand or not, amen"
"Fahri Hamzah, try to pay attention to the supporters of the candidate pair who are very polite in their mouths, don't accuse the candidate pair of being impolite, okay?"
the average candidate pair supporters are hypocrites
"The candidate's words are that free food is not enough to choose, amen, the vision and mission are clear"
"This is how the candidate pair cheats to prevent Anies from campaigning in Surabaya to coincide with this illegal concert, which is illegal because he said he was with him, even though it wasn't his campaign schedule in Surabaya, but his schedule."
"For example, if the candidate pair is not present at the debate, the candidate will still say that the candidate pair has mastered the debate because their main task is only the team, hooray."
thisssss candidate
you guys are complaining about the gemoy gemoy candidate pair now when you choose the cmn candidate pair because of your fatherly figure hahaha

"check it first, bro"
"no need to speak ill of anyone, all in Prabowo Gibran"
"It's true, Mr. Gibran, that people need proof, not promises, which is different from Onono, who just talks, talks"
"The victory of the candidate pair is your own victory, yes, the victory of the candidate pair is the victory of the elite, the rich oligarchs are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, the victory of the candidate pair is the victory of the people, and the little people give a finger salute"
"That's great, Mr. Wiranto, continue to support the candidate pair"
"Thank God, I got more support from the candidate pairs"
"managing agriculture is failing & full of corruption, food estate is not working, eh, dare to show up, managing social assistance and even sharing it, using it, inserting the candidate's vision and mission stickers, how not to damage the morals of the state minister doesn't want to resign, why is he campaigning, professor, role model for the people, thinks"

"It's like I remembered something like that, gaih gaiz"
"Everyone has seen the proof, it's not just a sweet promise"
"no need to badmouth anyone, the number is definitely the most appropriate"

"That's as sincere as your heart, sir"
"Is the candidate pair actually one team? The answer is that we don't know their behavior and plans behind the scenes, but it's a bit different, indeed, we're not God who knows everything, Professor Ahok"
That's the reason why Ms. Tsamara Amany should vote for Prabowo
Simulation of Kang Emil and Erick Thohir voting on the ballot box
"At the very least, the members of this recitation have been fully supported by Andre, who is supporting the candidate pair"
"This is how choosing the right leader according to Erick Thohir, agree or not"
"Is there anyone who has a presidential candidate as intelligent as this? What is clear is that the candidate is not a rival to this proud figure. Well, to win, it is certain that it was through cheating."
"always healthy, sir"
Sane people should know that mosques are for worship
"Indonesia needs young people, the next generation who are critical and brave enough to voice their opinions."
that's right and now the village head is really all out and is even willing to destroy his authority and self-esteem which has been good in the last year in order to help the candidate pairs. What's the point of the village head doing that to extend his breath so he can at least enter the second round?
"Hey, the kid knows that Prabowo is the next president"
"The more confident I am, I will choose Amen to be president"

"If the action to remove the president was moved by students from all over Indonesia and now the year after this dark history succeeded in overthrowing the New Order regime, a bigger movement to end the dictatorship of the sewer dynasty began to be echoed by Indonesian campus professors, I hope the candidate pairs will perish"
"People are questioning President Jokowi's actions in draining all the social assistance funds for the candidate pair campaign, whether the social assistance funds belonged to his ancestors."
"Indeed, it has been proven that the electability of candidate pairs in tolerant of fellow human beings is increasingly saluting and supporting the candidate pairs to lead this country, their real commitment is to strengthen tolerance."

Candidate pairs are not only about progress but also remember culture
Why is it that most people who are not for the candidate pair counter using the quality of the candidate pair's supporters even though the rich supporters don't make up the total number of supporters while those who are against the candidate pair always counter the candidate pair directly because of the quality of the candidate pair itself?
